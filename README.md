# 2D-Array-Rotation
This program is meant to read in a user given file and save the first two inputs as the rows and columns of an 2 dimensional array. Then the program allocates a 2 dimensional array using a pointer to an array of pointers. Next it saves the input from the file to the 2D array. Finally the program has a print function, rotate to right function, or rotate to the left function that all manipulate the saved array.  
To Compile use g++ rotation.cpp Array2D.cpp -o rotation  
To Run use ./rotation input.txt
